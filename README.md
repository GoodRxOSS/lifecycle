# Lifecycle

**Build ephemeral environments from pull requests.**

**What is lifecycle?**  
lifecycle is a tool that transforms pull requests into ephemeral development environments that seamlessly connect to required dependencies while remaining isolated from unrelated changes.

**Use Cases:**

- **Development:**  
  Isolated environments for feature branches to develop, without interference from others' work.

- **Testing:**  
  Fully connected and function environments for manula and automated testing.

- **Design Review:**  
  Live environments for product managers and designers to interact with new features.

- **External Sandboxes:**  
  Isolated sandboxes for partners and vendors that share only whatâ€™s necessary, avoiding full staging access.

**Note:**  
This repository is a placeholder used to gauge community interest. During this time, the codebase is being refined, documentation improved, and the project optimized for deployment in a variety of environments.
